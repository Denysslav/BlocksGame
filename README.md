# Overview
Breakout clone for university project. Currently under heavy development

# Installation
 - **TinyXML** is included in the repository. You just have to add it to your project in the IDE
 - Levels require base64 decoding. We are using Rene Nyffenegger's C++ implementation of the algorithm available for download [here](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/tree/master/base64)
 - **zlib** is also required for level decompressing. You can find the official website of zlib [here](https://zlib.net/)
 
# Requirements
